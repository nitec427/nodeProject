There’s plenty of work to be done at Manchester United as Erik ten Hag takes over the reins from Ralf Rangnick when the season ends. The Dutch boss will reportedly oversee a squad overhaul, which includes bringing in the right players and letting those who do not feature in his plans leave.

While these elements have been made clear, Cristiano Ronaldo remains a subject of intense storytelling by the media, who have often posted contrasting reports. One section insists the Portugal international could depart due to a lack of Champions League football, while other insists the striker will remain at the club and see out his contract.

There were even reports that ten Hag does not intend to count on Ronaldo’s services next season, although now it’s claimed the Dutch manager wants the striker to stay put for another season. With 24 goals to his name this term, hardly anyone can question the Portugal forward’s quality as he remains in top shape and form.
